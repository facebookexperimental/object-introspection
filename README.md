Object Introspection is a memory profiling technology for C++ objects. It provides the ability to dynamically instrument applications to capture the precise memory occupancy of entire object hierarchies including all containers and dynamic allocations. All this with no code modification or recompilation!

For more information on the technology and how to get started applying it  to your applications please check out the [Object Introspection](https://objectintrospection.org/) website.
